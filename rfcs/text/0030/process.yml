  title: Process
  group: 2
  short: These fields contain information about a process.
  description: >
    These fields contain information about a process.

    These fields can help you correlate metrics information with a process id/name
    from a log message.  The `process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is
    copied to the global field for correlation.
  type: group
  reusable:
    top_level: true
    expected:
      - at: process
        as: parent
        short_override: Information about the parent process.
      - at: process
        as: entry_leader
        short_override: Information about the entry session leader process.
      - at: process
        as: session_leader
        short_override: Information about the session leader process.
      - at: process
        as: group_leader
        short_override: Information about the process group leader process. Undefined if same as process.

  fields:

    - name: pid
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Process id.
      example: 4242

    - name: ppid
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >

      example: 4242

    - name: sid
      level: core

    - name: entity_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Unique identifier for the process.
      description: >
        Unique identifier for the process.

        The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some
        examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID,
        Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components
        of a process.

        Constructing a globally unique identifier is a common practice to mitigate
        PID reuse as well as to identify a specific process over time, across multiple
        monitored hosts.
      example: c2c455d9f99375d

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Process name.
      description: >

      description: >
        Length of the process.args array.

        This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on
        how many arguments were provided to start a process.
        More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity.
      example: 4

    - name: executable

        Absolute path to the process executable.

      example: true
      short: Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell.
      description: >
        Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell.

        Process interactivity is infered from the processes file descriptors. If the character device for the controlling tty is the same as stdin and stderr for the process, the process is considered interactive.

        Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session. Backgrounded processes are an example of this.

    - name: tty
      level: extended
      type: fd
      example: >
        process.tty = {
          char_device: {
            major: 4,
            minor: 1
          }
        }
      short: The file descriptor for the controlling tty (ctty).
      description: >
        The file descriptor for the controlling tty (ctty) of the session.

        If set, session is interactive.

    - name: env_vars
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: Array of environment variables.
      description: >
        Array of environment variables.

      normalize:
        - array

    - name: entry_meta
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: Information about the entry point for the session.
      description: >
        Information about the entry point for the session.

        This is only set on the nested process.entry_leader process.

    - name: entry_meta.type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The entry mechanism.
